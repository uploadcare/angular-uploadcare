angular-uploadcare
==================

Provides a directive for the [Uploadcare Widget](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/widget/).

Looking for a dead-simple way to integrate image uploading/cropping with your [Angularjs](http://angularjs.org) project? Then look no further! [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com) provides a fantastic widget for uploading images from multiple sources.  From their site:

>We handle files, so you donâ€™t have to.
>Uploadcare is a service that helps media creators,
>businesses and developers store, process
>and deliver visual content to their clients.

Combine this with the power of Angular and you've got yourself an image uploading solution that's far better than most other offerings.

*Note: I am in no way affiliated with Uploadcare. I was looking to add better image uploading to an Angular app and found Uploadcare to be one of the best solutions out there. Since there wasn't a directive for Angular, I decided to make one.*

#Usage

* Run `bower install angular-uploadcare` (or manually download/clone and install into your project's directory)
* Include bower_components/angular-uploadcare/angular-uploadcare.js
* Include the desired version of the [Uploadcare Widget](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/widget/). This directive works with at least version 2.1.2 `<script charset="utf-8" src="//ucarecdn.com/widget/2.1.2/uploadcare/uploadcare.min.js"></script>`. If you want use version without jQuery, include `uploadcare.full.min.js` instead of `uploadcare.min.js`.
* Add `ng-uploadcare` as a dependency for your app
* Insert the `uploadcare-widget` directive into your template file:
```
<uploadcare-widget
  ng-model="object.image.info.uuid"
  data-public-key="YOURKEYHERE"
  data-locale="en"
  data-tabs="file url"
  data-images-only="true"
  data-path-value="true"
  data-preview-step="true"
  data-clearable="true"
  data-multiple="false"
  data-crop="400:200"
  on-upload-complete="onUCUploadComplete(info)"
  on-widget-ready="onUCWidgetReady(widget)"
  value="{{ object.image.info.cdnUrl }}"
 />
 ```

#Options
This directive supports any of the configuration [options](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/widget/#configuration) defined by Uploadcare. In addition, it also supports the following options:

- `ng-model` The value to bind to
- `on-upload-complete` Fires once the file has been uploaded (and cropped if set). This function will receive the [file](https://uploadcare.com/documentation/javascript_api/#file) object from Uploadcare
- `value` Used to set the value for the input. Useful when you want to prepopulate the input value from elsewhere

Bring it on! I'll gladly accept PR's that are for the greater good of the module.
